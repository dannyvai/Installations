Don't worry it comes already installed :)

# Opencv for python
* Open a terminal
* sudo apt-get install python-opencv
* press `<enter>` or `Y` when it asks you if you really want to install those packages
and that's it

# Arduino IDE
* head over to https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software
* click on the appropriate version : Windows/Linux/32bit/64bit and so on..
* after downloading just right click on the file you downloaded and unzip it.
* now double click the arduino file inside

* If that doesn't work , open terminal and change the directory to where the arduino folder is for instance

`cd /home/course/Download/arduino-1.6.9/`
* write `./arduino` to start the IDE
