
# Python
I recommend you use the Winpython
* head over to https://sourceforge.net/projects/winpython/files/WinPython_2.7/2.7.10.3/
* download the appropriate version for your OS i.e. 32bit/64bit
* after downloading open the executable and install it (usually it's installed in the downloaded folder)
and that's it.

Now in your folder you have 2 interesting things
* WinPython Command Prompt.exe - command line with the python env. already configured
so if you want to start a python file you just write `python python-path.py`

* Spyder.exe - Python IDE
An easy environment to use python


# Opencv for python


# Arduino IDE
* head over to https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software
* click on the appropriate version : Windows/Linux/32bit/64bit and so on..
* after downloading just right click on the file you downloaded and unzip it.
* now double click the arduino file inside
