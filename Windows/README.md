I recommend you use the Winpython
* head over to https://sourceforge.net/projects/winpython/files/WinPython_2.7/2.7.10.3/
* download the appropriate version for your OS i.e. 32bit/64bit
* after downloading open the executable and install it (usually it's installed in the downloaded folder)
and that's it.

Now in your folder you have 2 interesting things
* WinPython Command Prompt.exe - command line with the python env. already configured
so if you want to start a python file you just write `python python-script-path.py`

* Spyder.exe - Python IDE
An easy environment to use python


# Opencv for python
* download pre-compiled package from http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#opencv (for python-2.7)
* open the WinPython Command Prompt.exe as stated above ^
* `pip install pip --upgrade`
* `pip install numpy --upgrade`
* `pip install path-to-downloaded-opencv-packge.whl`
and that's it.
Note that pip is the python package manager it works in windows and linux
Some of the packages pip is trying to install are using C/C++ code and should be compiled
So in that case you can download wheell files from http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/
Or download a suitable compiler https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=44266


# Arduino IDE
* head over to https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software
* click on the appropriate version : Windows/Linux/32bit/64bit and so on..
* after downloading just right click on the file you downloaded and unzip it.
* now double click the arduino file inside
